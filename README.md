A casual 2D platformer where you play as a bird collecting and delivering letters. [**Click here to play in the browser!**](https://matthewrf.itch.io/love-letters)

I developed this game solo in 72 hours for the game jam [Ludum Dare 53](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53). The theme we were given was "Delivery", and the only objective was to create a game from scratch based on that theme. This is what I ended up making - it was my first time participating in an event like this and it was a really fun experience.

## Controls

A / D - Move left/right

Spacebar - Jump

Spacebar (hold) - Glide

W - Deliver Letter

The game also supports arrow keys and controllers.
